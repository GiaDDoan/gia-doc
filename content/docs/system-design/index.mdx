title: System Design
description: Creating efficient and reliable system architectures!
---

System design involves creating a blueprint for software solutions, breaking down projects into components, and designing how they work together.
It's an exciting process of problem-solving and creative thinking to build reliable and scalable systems.

  exploration!

## Basic System Design

### 1. User Interface (UI)

The front-end layer that handles the presentation and interaction with users.
It includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code responsible for rendering the user interface and handling user input.

### 2. Web Server

A server that receives HTTP requests from clients (browsers) and responds with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
It handles routing, serves static files, and communicates with other components.

<Callout>
  Example: An Apache or Nginx server that receives HTTP requests from clients
  (browsers).
</Callout>

### 3. Application Server

This server-side component handles the business logic of the application. It receives requests from the web server,
processes data, interacts with databases, and performs any necessary computations or operations.

<Callout>
  Example: A Node.js server that runs the back-end application logic, handles
  business operations, processes user requests, interacts with databases, and
  generates dynamic content to be served to the client.
</Callout>

### 4. Database

A persistent storage system that stores application data. It could be a relational database like MySQL or PostgreSQL,
or a NoSQL database like MongoDB. The application server communicates with the database to read and write data.

<Callout>
  Example: For the MySQL database that stores user data, application settings,
  and other relevant information. It allows the application server to read from
  and write to the database using SQL queries to store and retrieve data.
</Callout>

### 5. APIs

Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) provide a way for different components to communicate and exchange data.
APIs define rules and protocols for data exchange, allowing the front-end (UI) to communicate with the application server or any external services.

<Callout>
  Example: RESTful APIs implemented using Express.js, which define endpoints and
  provide a way for the front-end to communicate with the application server.
  These APIs handle requests for data retrieval, data creation, and other
  application-specific operations.
</Callout>

### 6. Authentication & Authorization

Components responsible for user authentication and authorization. They handle user registration, login, session management,
and permissions to control access to specific resources.

<Callout>
  Example: User authentication and authorization handled using a JSON Web Token
  (JWT) approach. Users register and log in, and the server generates a token
  upon successful authentication. This token is then used to authorize
  subsequent requests and control access to protected resources.
</Callout>

### 7. Caching & Load Balancing

These components help improve system performance and scalability. Caching stores frequently accessed data in memory
for faster retrieval, while load balancing distributes incoming requests across multiple servers to handle increased traffic.

<Callout>
  Example: Redis as an in-memory cache to store frequently accessed data,
  reducing the load on the database and improving response times. Load balancing
  is achieved using a load balancer like NGINX or HAProxy, distributing incoming
  requests across multiple instances of the application server for better
  scalability and performance.
</Callout>

### 8. Monitoring & Logging

Tools and mechanisms for monitoring the system's health, performance, and error tracking.
Logging captures events and errors for analysis and debugging purposes."

<Callout>
  Example: Integration with monitoring and logging tools like New Relic or
  Datadog to track application performance, monitor server health, and collect
  logs for debugging and analysis purposes. Logs capture important events,
  errors, and system metrics for future reference.
