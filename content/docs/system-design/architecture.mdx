Defining the overall structure and organization of the system, such as choosing between monolithic or microservices
architecture, and determining how different components interact with each other.

## Important Aspects of System Architecture

### 1. Monolithic Architecture

This architecture style involves building the entire system as a single, self-contained unit. All components are
tightly coupled and run on a single platform. Monolithic architectures are relatively simple to develop and deploy but
can become challenging to maintain and scale as the system grows.

<Callout>

#### Examples:

- Content Management Systems (CMS) like WordPress or Drupal.
- Traditional desktop applications with a single executable file containing all the functionality.
- Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems where all modules are tightly integrated.

</Callout>

### 2. Client-Server Architecture

In this architecture, the system is divided into two main components: clients and servers.
Clients request services or resources from servers, which handle the processing and respond back to the clients.
This architecture allows for distributed computing, scalability, and separation of concerns between client and server components.

<Callout>

#### Examples:

- Web applications where the server handles business logic and data storage, while the client (web browser) renders
  the user interface. Examples include e-commerce websites, social media platforms, and online banking systems.

- Online multiplayer games where the game server manages game logic and player interactions.

</Callout>

### 3. Microservices Architecture

Microservices architecture decomposes the system into a collection of small,
independent services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. Each microservice
focuses on a specific business capability and communicates with other services via lightweight protocols like HTTP
or messaging queues. This architecture enables agility, scalability, and resilience but introduces
complexities in managing inter-service communication and data consistency.

<Callout>

#### Examples:

- Netflix: Each microservice handles specific functionalities such as user authentication, content recommendation, billing, and video streaming.
- Uber: Microservices handle tasks like ride requests, payments, driver management, and mapping.

</Callout>

### 4. Event-Driven Architecture

This architectural style revolves around the concept of events. Components or services
communicate by producing and consuming events. Event-driven architectures are highly
scalable and loosely coupled, as components can react to events asynchronously. They
are well-suited for real-time data processing, event sourcing, and reactive systems.

<Callout>

#### Examples:

- Real-time analytics systems where data events are ingested, processed, and analyzed in real-time to generate insights or trigger actions.
- Internet of Things (IoT) applications where devices generate events that trigger actions or updates in the system, such as smart home automation or industrial monitoring systems.

</Callout>

### 5. Layered Architecture

This architecture organizes the system components into multiple layers, each responsible
for a specific set of functionalities. Typically, a layered architecture consists of presentation,
business logic, and data layers. Each layer communicates with the adjacent layers, following
a defined set of protocols and interfaces. Layered architectures promote separation of concerns and modularity.

<Callout>

#### Examples:

- Three-tier web applications with a presentation layer (web UI), application layer (business logic), and data layer (database).
- Enterprise software with layers for presentation, application services, business logic, data access, and data storage.

</Callout>

### 6. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)

SOA emphasizes building applications as a collection of loosely coupled services that
communicate with each other through standardized protocols. Services in an SOA can be independently
developed, deployed, and versioned. This architecture promotes reusability, interoperability, and flexibility.

<Callout>

#### Examples:

- Payment gateways where services handle payment processing, fraud detection, and transaction management.
- Healthcare systems with services for patient registration, appointment scheduling, medical records, and billing.

</Callout>

## Conclusion

While choosing an architecture, it's crucial to consider factors like scalability, performance,
maintainability, fault tolerance, and the specific requirements of the system. There is
no one-size-fits-all solution, and a combination of architectural patterns may be employed to
address different aspects of the system. The chosen architecture should align with the goals,
constraints, and future growth of the system.
