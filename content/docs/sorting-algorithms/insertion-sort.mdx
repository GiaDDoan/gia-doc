title: Insertion Sort
description: Build the sorted array one element at a time!
---

Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one element at a time.
It works by iteratively considering each element in the array and placing it in its correct position within the already sorted subarray.

Insertion Sort has an average time complexity of O(n^2) but performs well for small arrays or partially sorted arrays.
It is an in-place sorting algorithm, meaning it does not require additional memory beyond the input array.

## Examples

### 1. Everyday Applications

<Callout>

#### 1a. Ordering a Deck of Cards

Imagine you have a deck of cards that is randomly shuffled.
To arrange the cards in ascending or descending order, you can use Insertion Sort.

Start with an empty hand and pick cards from the deck one by one.
For each new card, compare it with the cards in your hand and place it in the correct position.
Repeat this process until you have picked all the cards, resulting in a sorted deck.

##### 1b. Arranging Names in a Guest List

Suppose you have a guest list with names in no particular order.
You can use Insertion Sort to arrange the names alphabetically.

Start with an empty sorted list and consider each name in the unsorted list.
Compare it with the names in the sorted list and insert it in the correct position.
Continue this process until all names are placed in the sorted order.

### 2. Coding Scenarios

##### 2a. Sorting an Array of Students

Consider an array of student objects, where each object represents a student with properties like name, age, and grade.
To sort the students based on a specific property (e.g., grade or age), you can use Insertion Sort.

Begin with an empty sorted array and iterate over the unsorted array.
For each student, compare the value of the desired property with the students in the sorted array
and insert the student in the appropriate position to maintain the desired order.

##### 2b. Ordering an Array of Dates

Suppose you have an array of dates in no particular order.
To arrange the dates chronologically, you can use Insertion Sort.

Start with an empty sorted array and consider each date in the unsorted array.
Compare it with the dates in the sorted array and insert it in the correct position.
Repeat this process until all dates are placed in the sorted order.

```js
function insertionSort(arr) {
  const n = arr.length;

  for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    const key = arr[i]; // Select the current element as the key
    let j = i - 1; // Set the initial position for comparison

    while (j >= 0 && arr[j] > key) {
      arr[j + 1] = arr[j]; // Shift elements greater than the key to the right
      j--; // Move to the previous position for comparison
    }

    arr[j + 1] = key; // Place the key in its correct position
  }

  return arr; // Return the sorted array
}

// Example usage
const arr = [7, 2, 5, 1, 8, 3];
const sortedArr = insertionSort(arr); // Call the insertionSort function to sort the array
console.log(sortedArr); // Output the sorted array
```
