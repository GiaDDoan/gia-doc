title: Merge Sort
description: Divide, conquer, and merge for sorted order!
---

Merge Sort is a popular sorting algorithm that follows the divide-and-conquer approach.
It works by recursively dividing the array into smaller subarrays, sorting them individually,
and then merging them back together in sorted order.

The merging process combines the sorted subarrays
by comparing elements and placing them in the correct order. Merge Sort is known for its stability,
predictable time complexity of O(n log n), and suitability for handling large datasets.

## Examples

### 1. Everyday Applications

<Callout>

##### 1a. Music playlist sorting:

Imagine you have a large music playlist with songs in random order.
To organize your playlist alphabetically or by song duration, you can use Merge Sort.

Divide the playlist into smaller parts and sort each part based on the song's title or duration. Then, merge the sorted parts
together, comparing the songs and placing them in the correct order. This way, you can have a
well-organized and enjoyable playlist.

##### 1b. Bookshelf organization:

If you have a messy bookshelf with books of various genres and authors,
Merge Sort can help you organize it systematically.

Split the books into smaller groups based on genres or authors. Sort each
group independently,arranging the books within each category.
Merge the sorted groups together, considering the genre or author, to
create an organized bookshelf where books of the same genre or author are grouped together.

### 2. Coding Scenarios

<Callout>
##### 2a. Sorting an Array:

Implement Merge Sort to sort an array of numbers in ascending or descending order.
This scenario involves dividing the array into smaller subarrays, recursively sorting them,
and merging the sorted subarrays to obtain the final sorted array.

</Callout>

<Callout>

##### 2b. External Sorting:

In scenarios where the dataset is too large to fit in memory, Merge Sort can be used for external sorting.
This involves reading chunks of data from external storage, sorting them using Merge Sort,
and merging the sorted chunks until the entire dataset is sorted.

## Code Snippet

<Callout>

This is an example in JavaScript, you can try it out and make your own modification! [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/merge-sort-thh9yw)

</Callout>

```js
function mergeSort(arr) {
  // Base case: if the array has 0 or 1 element, it is already sorted
  if (arr.length <= 1) {
    return arr;
  }

  // Divide the array into two halves
  const mid = Math.floor(arr.length / 2);
  const leftHalf = arr.slice(0, mid);
  const rightHalf = arr.slice(mid);

  // Recursively sort the two halves
  const sortedLeft = mergeSort(leftHalf);
  const sortedRight = mergeSort(rightHalf);

  // Merge the sorted halves
  return merge(sortedLeft, sortedRight);
}

function merge(left, right) {
  let merged = [];
  let leftIndex = 0;
  let rightIndex = 0;

  // Merge the two sorted subarrays
  while (leftIndex < left.length && rightIndex < right.length) {
    if (left[leftIndex] <= right[rightIndex]) {
      merged.push(left[leftIndex]);
      leftIndex++;
    } else {
      merged.push(right[rightIndex]);
      rightIndex++;
    }
  }

  // Append any remaining elements from the left or right subarray
  return merged.concat(left.slice(leftIndex)).concat(right.slice(rightIndex));
}

// Example usage
const arr = [7, 2, 5, 1, 8, 3];
const sortedArr = mergeSort(arr);
console.log(sortedArr);
```
