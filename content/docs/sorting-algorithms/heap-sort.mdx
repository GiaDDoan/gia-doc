title: Heap Sort
description: Efficient sorting using a binary heap!
---

Heap Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure.
It leverages the heap property to efficiently build a sorted array.

The algorithm first builds a max heap from the input array. In a max heap, the parent nodes are greater than or equal to their children.
After building the max heap, the largest element (at the root) is swapped with the last element of the heap and removed from consideration.
The process is repeated for the remaining elements until the entire array is sorted in ascending order.

## Examples

### 1. Everyday Applications

##### 1a. Event Scheduling

Heap Sort can aid in scheduling and managing events in a calendar application.

For instance, consider a calendar application where users create events with different start times.
Heap Sort can be used to sort the events based on their start times, enabling efficient retrieval and display of the scheduled events in chronological order.
This ensures that users can easily visualize their events and plan their day effectively.

##### 1b. Sports Leaderboard
Heap Sort can be employed to maintain and update a sports leaderboard in real-time.

Imagine a sports competition where participants earn points based on their performance.
To display the leaderboard in descending order of points, Heap Sort can be used.
With Heap Sort, you can efficiently update the leaderboard as new scores come in and ensure that the players are ranked correctly.

### 2. Coding Scenarios

<Callout>
##### 2a. Sorting an Array of Numbers

Suppose you have an array of numbers that you want to sort in ascending or descending order.
You can use Heap Sort to efficiently rearrange the elements and obtain the desired sorted array.

Heap Sort builds a max heap from the array and repeatedly extracts the maximum element from the heap,
placing it in the sorted portion of the array. By repeating this process, the entire array becomes sorted.

</Callout>

##### 2b. Sorting an Array of Objects

If you have an array of objects, each containing a key or attribute, and you want to sort the array based on that key,
Heap Sort can be a suitable choice.

Create a comparison function that compares the desired key or attribute of two objects.
Use the comparison function to build a max heap, and then extract the maximum element iteratively
to obtain the sorted array based on the desired key.

```js
function heapSort(arr) {
  const n = arr.length;

  // Build a max heap
  buildMaxHeap(arr);

  // Heapify the array
  for (let i = n - 1; i > 0; i--) {
    // Swap the root (maximum element) with the last element
    swap(arr, 0, i);

    // Restore the max heap property
    heapify(arr, i, 0);
  }

  return arr;
}

function buildMaxHeap(arr) {
  const n = arr.length;
  const startIdx = Math.floor(n / 2) - 1;

  // Heapify each subtree starting from the last non-leaf node
  for (let i = startIdx; i >= 0; i--) {
    heapify(arr, n, i);
  }
}

function heapify(arr, n, rootIdx) {
  let largestIdx = rootIdx;
  const leftIdx = 2 * rootIdx + 1;
  const rightIdx = 2 * rootIdx + 2;

  // Find the largest element among the root and its children
  if (leftIdx < n && arr[leftIdx] > arr[largestIdx]) {
    largestIdx = leftIdx;
  }

  if (rightIdx < n && arr[rightIdx] > arr[largestIdx]) {
    largestIdx = rightIdx;
  }

  // Swap the root with the largest element if needed
  if (largestIdx !== rootIdx) {
    swap(arr, rootIdx, largestIdx);

    // Recursively heapify the affected subtree
    heapify(arr, n, largestIdx);
  }
}

function swap(arr, i, j) {
  const temp = arr[i];
  arr[i] = arr[j];
  arr[j] = temp;
}

// Example usage
const arr = [7, 2, 5, 1, 8, 3];
const sortedArr = heapSort(arr);
console.log(sortedArr);
```
