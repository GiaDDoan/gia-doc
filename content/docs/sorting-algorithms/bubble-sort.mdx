title: Bubble Sort
description: Simple sorting through repeated comparisons!
---

Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
The algorithm iterates through the array multiple times, gradually moving the largest (or smallest) elements towards their correct positions.

Although Bubble Sort has a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst case, it can be useful for small datasets or partially sorted arrays.

## Examples

### 1. Everyday Applications

<Callout>
##### 1a. Sorting a Deck of Cards:

Imagine you have a deck of cards that is randomly shuffled.
To arrange the cards in ascending or descending order, you can use Bubble Sort.

Start with the first card and compare it with the next card. If they are in the wrong order, swap them.
Continue this process throughout the deck until all the cards are sorted.
Bubble Sort is a straightforward algorithm to sort a small deck of cards.

##### 1b. Grade Sorting:

In an educational setting, Bubble Sort can be used to sort student grades in ascending or descending order.

Compare the grades of adjacent students and swap them if they are in the wrong order.
Continue iterating through the grades until the list is sorted.
Bubble Sort provides a simple way to arrange grades for analysis or reporting purposes.

### 2. Coding Scenarios

<Callout>
##### 2a. Sorting an Array:

Implement Bubble Sort to sort an array of numbers in ascending or descending order.
This scenario involves repeatedly comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if necessary.

</Callout>

<Callout>
##### 2b. Checking for Sortedness:

Bubble Sort can also be used to check if an array is already sorted.

By performing a pass through the array with Bubble Sort, you can determine if any swaps were made.
If no swaps occur during a pass, it indicates that the array is already sorted.

```js
function bubbleSort(arr) {
  const n = arr.length;

  for (let i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
    let swapped = false;

    for (let j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
      if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
        // Swap elements if they are in the wrong order
        const temp = arr[j];
        arr[j] = arr[j + 1];
        arr[j + 1] = temp;

        swapped = true;
      }
    }

    // If no swaps occur during a pass, the array is already sorted
    if (!swapped) {
      break;
    }
  }

  return arr;
}

// Example usage
const arr = [7, 2, 5, 1, 8, 3];
const sortedArr = bubbleSort(arr);
console.log(sortedArr);
