title: Quick Sort
description: Efficient sorting using the divide-and-conquer approach!
---

Quick Sort is a widely used sorting algorithm that follows the divide-and-conquer approach.
It works by selecting a pivot element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays,
according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then recursively sorted.

Quick Sort is known for its efficiency and average time complexity of O(n log n).
It is often faster in practice compared to other sorting algorithms and widely used in various applications.

## Examples

### 1. Everyday Applications

<Callout>
##### 1a. Sorting Names in an Address Book:

Consider an address book with names in random order.
To alphabetically sort the names, you can use Quick Sort.

Choose a pivot element from the list of names and partition the remaining names into two sub-arrays:
one with names smaller than the pivot and another with names greater than the pivot.
Recursively apply Quick Sort to both sub-arrays and combine the sorted results to obtain the final sorted list.

</Callout>

##### 1b. Employee Ranking by Performance:

Suppose you have a list of employees with their performance scores.
To rank them based on their performance, you can use Quick Sort.

Select a pivot element (e.g., median performance score) and partition the employees into two sub-arrays:
one with employees having scores lower than the pivot and another with scores higher than the pivot.
Recursively apply Quick Sort to both sub-arrays and merge the sorted results to obtain the final ranking.

</Callout>

### 2. Coding Scenarios

<Callout>
##### 2a. Sorting an Array:

Implement Quick Sort to sort an array of numbers in ascending or descending order.
This scenario involves selecting a pivot, partitioning the array, and recursively sorting the sub-arrays.

</Callout>

<Callout>
##### 2b. Duplicates Removal:

In scenarios where an array contains duplicate elements, Quick Sort can be used to remove duplicates and obtain a distinct sorted array.

By applying Quick Sort, the duplicates are grouped together during partitioning.
After sorting, the duplicates can be removed to obtain a distinct array.

## Code Snippet

<Callout>
  This is an example in JavaScript, you can try it out and make your own
  modifications! [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/quick-sort-qzvllp)
</Callout>

```js
function quickSort(arr) {
  // Base case: if the array has 0 or 1 element, it is already sorted
  if (arr.length <= 1) {
    return arr;
  }

  const pivot = arr[arr.length - 1]; // Select the last element as the pivot
  const left = [];
  const right = [];

  // Partition the array into two sub-arrays
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++) {
    if (arr[i] <= pivot) {
      left.push(arr[i]);
    } else {
      right.push(arr[i]);
    }
  }

  // Recursively sort the sub-arrays and combine the results
  return [...quickSort(left), pivot, ...quickSort(right)];
}

// Example usage
const arr = [7, 2, 5, 1, 8, 3];
const sortedArr = quickSort(arr);
console.log(sortedArr);
```
